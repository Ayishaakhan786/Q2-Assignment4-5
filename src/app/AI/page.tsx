        <p>AI refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human
           intelligence, such as understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and making decisions.
           AI can analyze vast amounts of data at incredible speeds, uncovering patterns and insights that might
           be impossible for humans to discern.As AI continues to advance, ethical considerations surrounding privacy,
           bias, and the impact on employment are crucial, leading to ongoing discussions about how best to harness this
           powerful technology responsibly.AI plays a crucial role in robotics, allowing machines to perceive their environment,
           make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously, from manufacturing to household chores.AI is used across various sectors,
           including healthcare, finance,transportation,and entertainment.AI has the potential to revolutionize industries, improve 
           efficiency, and enhance decision-making, driving innovation and creating new opportunities for economic growth and societal
            advancement.
